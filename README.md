## Description
A classic Pong game with a modern twist, where new balls are added over time, creating increasing chaos and requiring players to adapt quickly. This simple mechanic shift adds layers of intensity and unpredictability, showcasing how even subtle changes in interactivity can create unique experiences in digital media.
In my files I have included the sounds folder which has the different sound effects as wav files, as well as the requirements txt file to describe the requirements of random and pygame.
